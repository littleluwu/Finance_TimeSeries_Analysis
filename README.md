# 📈 **Finance Time Series Analysis**

The project in this repository involves a time series analysis of financial stock data, studying their characteristics, estimating various modeling strategies, and forecasting future values. This is part of an assignment for the class `1003823 - ACIEPE: ANÁLISE DE SÉRIES TEMPORAIS FINANCEIRAS USANDO O R`, lecture at the **Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar)**, by the professor **Andreza A. Palma**

## 🗂️ **Repository Structure**

The repository is structured according to the main topics covered in the class. The subjects are organized into separate folders, each containing an R Markdown file and an HTML rendering of that notebook. For this analysis, we extracted time series from Brazilian stock data of companies, as well as the IBOVESPA and SP500 indices.

Throughout the process of analysis, we used several libraries to import the data and to provide support operations within the notebooks. They are key to running the R sections and need to be available in the environment. Here is a list of the used libraries:

- BatchGetSymbols
- rugarch
- tidyverse
- ggthemes
- FinTS
- WriteXLS
- xtable
- tbl2xts
- forecast
- tseries
- timeSeries
